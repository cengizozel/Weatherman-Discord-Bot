# Weatherman-Discord-Bot

A Discord bot that uses OpenWeatherMap API to get weather data and GPT-3 to communicate with people. I use repl.it to host the bot 24/7. I made this for my girlfriend, so there are some hardcoded prompts and outputs which can be replaced by anyone who is interested in using this.

Current features:
- Get weather for one location with the use of OpenWeatherMap
- Give clothing suggestions based on weather and wind conditions
- Can have a chat about anything with the use of GPT-3

Planned features:
- Weather data for the upcoming days
- Can fix English grammar mistakes
- Give more background information on who the bot is

If you have any suggestions or feedback, please let me know!
